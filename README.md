# My random codes

This is where I keep my codes that some people usually can't access and I really like or use a lot, so I just throw them here. Enjoy!<br>
**-_[|]_-** These codes are mainly used for Developers **-_[|]_-**

### Current codes and what they do:
> ###### Brickie - _A randomly rotating and resizing static shape_ [required a file for this]
> ###### Camera - _Lets you edit the camera w/ rotation & angles_
###### Death - _Similar to TOB or V0002, adds death 'jokes'_
###### returnVar - _Upon use, returns what type of var you have._
###### Tumble - _Makes your character... tumble_

## Want to use these codes?<br>
You're free to! All I ask is that you give me credit, you don't have to, but it would be much appreciated.
