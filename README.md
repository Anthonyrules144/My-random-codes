# Random-Blockland-Codes

### **WARNING**:
###### These codes might be very old, not work properly (mostly gamemodes only though), have issues, ect.

___

This is where I will keep completely random gamemodes, codes, little server scripts, and more that I'm willing to release <br/>
All the codes will be released with a tag inside them showing what year they were created.

Anything released here I don't care what you do with, it was created for fun most likely.

If a code isn't in a folder and is sitting in the folder this readme is in, it means the file can be used for both server and client
