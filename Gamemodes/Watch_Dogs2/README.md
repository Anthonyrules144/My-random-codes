# Watch_Dogs2 gamemode

This gamemode was created completely randomly because I challenged myself at the beggining of 2017 to try and replicate something from a game that was already made. If you plan on using this, please do look through the files since this gamemode is completely random and might not be setup right for other servers.

Currently, you can control vehicles, and you can put down bricks and make them do whatever via events. I'm unsure if the GUI's work correctly.
