Thank you for checking out my Watch_Dogs2 mod,

Try not to go over 20 characters, the status or job may go over the GUI length

When using multiple statuses with [], you can use <> for a sentenced status, such as `[<Hello there> Hi] young one`
Each "multiple status" is chosen at random for players just like regular statuses are.

Also keep in mind, do not say this mod was yours, it is not. You may own this modification and edit it, but please, give credit where it's due, thanks!
